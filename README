This is the open source project that intends to build libraries for algorithms.
My idea was to build a first basic solutions for some algorithms. Make it work.
Then read more materials on efficenciy for the language (efficent C++). Fine tu
-ne the implementation of the algorithm. Make sure it works. Then I improve bot
-h the algorithm knowledge and the language proficiency.
